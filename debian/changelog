dnscap (1.4.1-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 1.4.1

    Fixed an issue that when compiled with libpcap that had a specific
    feature enabled it would result in a runtime error which could not be
    worked around.

    Also fixed various compatibility issues and updated dependency
    documentation for CentOS.

dnscap (1.4.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 1.4.0

    Until it can be confirmed that the threaded code works as well as the
    non-threaded code it has been made optional and requires a configuration
    option to enable it during compilation.

    New extended option:
    - `-o pcap_buffer_size=<bytes>` can be used to increase the capture
      buffer within pcap-thread/libpcap, this can help mitigate dropped
      packets by the kernel during breaks (like when closing dump file).

dnscap (1.3.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 1.3.0

    Rare lockup has been fixed that could happen if a signal was received
    in the wrong thread at the wrong time due to `pcap_thread_stop()`
    canceling and waiting on threads to join again. The handling of signals
    have been improved for threaded and non-threaded operations.

    New features:
    - Experimental CBOR DNS Stream format output, see `CBOR_DNS_STREAM.md`
    - Extended options to specify user and group to use when dropping
      privileges, see EXTENDED OPTIONS in man-page

dnscap (1.2.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 1.2.0

    Update `pcap-thread` to v1.2.0 to get the new callback queue mode which
    puts that mode into using pthread conditions if all pcaps are offline and
    keeps us from losing packets.

    Use `pcap_thread_dropback()` callback to get the notification when a
    packet was dropped because the queue was full, indicating that we can't
    process all the packets.  Added this stats to the `-S` output as total
    and per interface as `ptdrop`.  Changed the output for each interface
    to not cut of information, for example interface name was cut to
    4 characters.

    Other changes:

    - Add extended options `-o <option>=<value>` because we are running out
      of short options.
    - Better handling of library checks and automake rules
    - New option `-F <format>` to specify the format of the output in `-w`
    - Add experimental CBOR output support
      - LDNS is used to parse the packets
      - Tinycbor is used to construct the CBOR output
      - DNS-in-JSON draft [1] for representing the objects
      - Check CBOR topic in README.md for more information
    - When only reading offline pcap files it will not attempt to drop
      privileges and add new option `-N` to explicitly not drop privileges.

dnscap (1.1.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 1.1.0

    The ownership of DNSCAP was transferred from ISC to DNS-OARC in
    the summer of 2016 and this is the first release since that.

    This project now uses Semantic Versioning and these are the changes
    since the `dnscap-20160205` release (which can also be found using
    the tag `v0.0.0-20160205`).

    Highlights:
    - Restructure repository and use autotools
    - Compiled and tested on Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, FreeBSD and OpenBSD
      using Jenkins and Travis-CI
    - Source code static analysis using Coverity Scan
    - Compatibility fixes for FreeBSD, OpenBSD and OS X
    - ABI change to `output()`, previous `isfrag` is now a `flags` that
      represents what the packet is through a bitmask
    - Use helper library `pcap-thread` when capturing to solve missing
      packets during very low traffic

    New command line options:
    - `-V`: Prints version and then exits
    - `-M`: Enable monitor mode on interfaces
    - `-D`: Enable immediate mode on interfaces
    - `-W`: Allow to specify a suffix for the pcap dump file
    - `-C`: Limit/rotate capture after a certain amount of bytes

    Special thanks to:
    - Duane Wessels
    - Paul Vixie
    - Klaus Darilion
