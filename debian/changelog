dnscap (1.10.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 1.10.0

    This release adds a new plugin type "filter" and 5 new plugins that can
    do anonymization, deanonymization and masking of the IP addresses.

    New features:
    - Check plugins for `pluginname_type()` which returns `enum plugin_type`,
      if missing the plugin is counted as an "output" plugin
    - New plugin type "filter" which calls `pluginname_filter()` prior of
      outputting any data or calling of "output" plugins, if the new function
      returns non-zero then the packet is filtered out (dropped)
    - New extension `DNSCAP_EXT_SET_IADDR` that gives access to a function
      for setting the from and to IP addresses both in the extracted data
      and the wire

    New plugins:
    - `anonaes128`: Anonymize IP addresses using AES128
    - `anonmask`: Pseudo-anonymize IP addresses by masking them
    - `cryptopan`: Anonymize IP addresses using an extension to Crypto-PAn
      (College of Computing, Georgia Tech) made by David Stott (Lucent)
    - `cryptopant`: Anonymize IP addresses using cryptopANT, a different
      implementation of Crypto-PAn made by the ANT project at USC/ISI
    - `ipcrypt`: Anonymize IP addresses using ipcrypt create by
      Jean-Philippe Aumasson

    Bugfixes:
    - Fix changing `royparse` and `txtout` with other plugins (thanks to
      Duane Wessels and Paul Hoffman)
    - Free pointers to allocated strings in `text_free()` (thanks to Michał
      Kępień)
    - Fix IP checksum calculation

    Other changes:
    - `-B` and `-E` can be used without `-w` (thanks to Duane Wessels)
    - Use `pcap_findalldevs()` instead of `pcap_lookupdev()` (thanks to
      Michał Kępień)
    - Document and add `-?` option to all plugins
    - Fix clang `scan-build` bugs and LGTM alerts
    - Use `gmtime_r()` instead of `gmtime()`
    - Update `pcap-thread` to v4.0.0

dnscap (1.9.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 1.9.0

    This release adds a new option to change how the Berkeley Packet Filter
    is generated to include the host restrictions for all selections,
    previously this restriction would only apply to specific parts.

    Additional tweaks to the RSSM plugin has been made to conform to the
    RSSAC002v3 specification. One noticeable change is that the plugin now
    requires the DNS to be parsed before counted, any error in the parsing
    will result in the message being left out of the statistics.

    Changes:
    - Fix spacing in BPF filter to look better
    - Fix #146: Add `bpf_hosts_apply_all`, apply any host restriction to all
    - `plugin/rssm`:
      - Remove quoting of `start-period` and correctly handle empty hashes
      - Issue #152, Issue #91: Parse DNS before processing RSSM counters
    - `plugin/rssm/dnscap-rssm-rssac002`: Use `YAML::Dump()` for output

dnscap (1.8.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 1.8.0

    This release updates the TCP stream code in order to be able to look
    at more then just the first query, for handling already ongoing TCP
    connections without having seen SYN/ACK and for reassembly of the TCP
    stream prior of parsing it for DNS with an additional layer of parsing
    (see `reassemble_tcp_bfbparsedns`).

    Updates to the Root Server Scaling Measurement (RSSM) plugin have also
    been made to bring it up to date with RSSAC002v3 specification, be
    able to output the YAML format described and an additional script to
    merge YAML files if the interval is less then the RSSAC002v3 24 hour
    period. See "Updates to the RSSM plugin" below and
    `plugins/rssm/README.md`.

    New extended options:
    - `parse_ongoing_tcp`: Start tracking TCP connections even if SYN/ACK
      has not been seen
    - `allow_reset_tcpstate`: Allow external reset of TCP state
    - `reassemble_tcp`: Use to enable TCP stream reassembly
    - `reassemble_tcp_faultreset`: Number of faults before reseting TCP
      state when reassembly is enabled
    - `reassemble_tcp_bfbparsedns`: Enable an experimental additional layer
      of reassemble that uses `libbind` to parse the payload before accepting
      it. If the DNS is invalid it will move 2 bytes within the payload and
      treat it as a new payload, taking the DNS length again and restart
      the process. Requires `libbind` and `reassemble_tcp`.

    New extension functions for plugins:
    - `DNSCAP_EXT_TCPSTATE_GETCURR`: Function to get a pointer for the
      current TCP state
    - `DNSCAP_EXT_TCPSTATE_RESET`: Function to reset a TCP state

    New features:
    - Parse additional DNS queries in TCP connections
    - `-g` and the `txtout` plugin will reset TCP state (if allowed) on
      failure to parse DNS

    Bugfixes:
    - Fix `-g` output, separate error message with a space
    - Fix TCP packets wrongfully flagged as DNS when using layers.
    - Fix TCP debug output when using layers, `ia_str()` is not safe to call
      twice in the same `printf` because of local buffer.
    - Fix exported extension functions, need to be file local

    New tests for:
    - Multiple DNS queries in one TCP connection
    - Query over TCP without SYN
    - Queries over TCP with first query missing length
    - Queries over TCP with middle payloads missing
    - Add test with TCP stream that missing multiple packets in the middle

    Updates to the RSSM plugin (`plugins/rssm`):
    - Add info about saving counts and sources
    - Fix memory leak on `fopen()` errors
    - Update to RSSAC002v3 specification
    - New options:
      - `-D` to disable forking on close
      - `-Y`: Use RSSAC002v3 YAML format when writing counters, the file
        will contain multiple YAML documents, one for each RSSAC002v3 metric
        Used with; -S adds custom metric `dnscap-rssm-sources` and -A adds
        `dnscap-rssm-aggregated-sources`
      - `-n`: Set the service name to use in RSSAC002v3 YAML
      - `-S`: Write source IPs into counters file with the prefix `source`
      - `-A`: Write aggregated IPv6(/64) sources into counters file with
        the prefix `aggregated-source`
      - `-a`: Write aggregated IPv6(/64) sources to
        `<name>.<timesec>.<timeusec>`
    - Add `dnscap-rssm-rssac002` Perl script for merging RSSAC002v3 YAML files
    - Add README.md for the plugin man-page for `dnscap-rssm-rssac002`
    - Add test for YAML output and merging of YAML files

dnscap (1.7.1-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 1.7.1

    The library used for parsing DNS (libbind) is unable to parse DNS
    messages when there is padding at the end (the UDP/TCP payload is larger
    then the DNS message). This has been fixed by trying to find the actual
    DNS message size, walking all labels and RR data, and then retry parsing.

    Other changes and bug-fixes:
    - Fix size when there is a VLAN to match output of `use_layers` yes/no
    - Add test of VLAN matching
    - Fix `hashtbl.c` building in `rssm`
    - Add test with padded DNS message

            actual size and reparse

dnscap (1.7.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 1.7.0

    This release adds IP fragmentation handling by using layers in pcap-thread
    which also adds a new flag to output and modules. `DNSCAP_OUTPUT_ISLAYER`
    indicates that `pkt_copy` is equal to `payload` since the layers of the
    traffic have already been parsed. IP fragments are reassembled with the
    `pcap_thread_ext_frag` extension that is included in pcap-thread.

    New extended (`-o`) options:
    - `use_layers`: Use pcap-thread layers to handle the traffic
    - `defrag_ipv4`: Enabled IPv4 de-fragmentation
    - `defrag_ipv6`: Enabled IPv6 de-fragmentation
    - `max_ipv4_fragments`: Set maximum fragmented IPv4 packets to track
    - `max_ipv4_fragments_per_packet`: Set the maximum IPv4 fragments per
      tracked packet
    - `max_ipv6_fragments`: Set maximum fragmented IPv6 packets to track
    - `max_ipv6_fragments_per_packet`: Set the maximum IPv6 fragments per
      tracked packet

    Currently `-w` does not work with `use_layers` and the plugins `pcapdump`
    and `royparse` will discard output with the flag `DNSCAP_OUTPUT_ISLAYER`
    because they need access to the original packet.

    The `rzkeychange` plugin now encodes certain flag bits in the data that
    it reports for RFC8145 key tag signaling. The flags of interest are:
    `DO`, `CD`, and `RD`. These are encoded in an bit-mask as a hexadecimal
    value before the `_ta` component of the query name.

    Other changes and bug-fixes:
    - Fix #115: document `-g` output, see `OUTPUT FORMATS` `diagnostic` in
      `dnscap(1)` man-page
    - Add test to match output from non-layers runs with those using layers
    - Add test with fragmented DNS queries
    - Fix #120: CBOR/CDS compiles again, update tinycbor to v0.4.2
    - Fix `ip->ip_len` byte order
    - Fix parsing of IP packets with padding or missing parts of payload

dnscap (1.6.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 1.6.0

    New additions to the plugins:
    - `rzkeychange` can now collect RFC8145 key tag signaling. Signals are
      saved during the collection interval, and then sent to the specified
      `-k <zone>`, one at a time, at the end of the interval. Only root zone
      signals are collected. Added by Duane Wessels (@wessels).
    - `royparse` is a new plugin to splits a PCAP into two streams, queries
      in PCAP format and responses in ASCII format. Created by Roy Arends
      (@RoyArends).
    - `txtout` new option `-s` for short output, only print QTYPE and QNAME
      for IN records. Added by Paul Hoffman (@paulehoffman)
    - The extension interface has been extended with `DNSCAP_EXT_IA_STR` to
      export the `ia_str()` function.

    Bugfixes and other changes:
    - Remove duplicated hashtbl code
    - `rssm`: fix bug where count in table was taken out as `uint16_t` but
      was a `uint64_t`
    - Handle return values from hashtbl functions
    - `txtout`: removed unused `-f` options
    - Change `ia_str()` to use buffers with correct sizes, thanks to
      @RoyArends for spotting this!

dnscap (1.5.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 1.5.0

    Added support for writing gzipped PCAP if the `-W` suffix ends with
    `.gz` and made `-X` work without `-x`. New inteface for plugins to
    tell them what extensions are available and a new plugin `rzkeychange`.

    Plugin extensions:
    - Call `plugin_extension(ext, arg)` to tell plugin what extensions exists
    - Add extension for checking responder (`is_responder()`)

    The rzkeychange plugin was developed by Duane Wessels 2016 in support
    of the root zone ZSK size increase. It is also being used in support of
    the 2017 root KSK rollover and collects the following measurements:
    - total number of responses sent
    - number of responses with TC bit set
    - number of responses over TCP
    - number of DNSKEY responses
    - number of ICMP_UNREACH_NEEDFRAG messages received
    - number of ICMP_TIMXCEED_INTRANS messages received
    - number of ICMP_TIMXCEED_REASS messages received

    Other fixes (author Duane Wessels):

    - e4ee2d3: The rzkeychange data collection plugin uses
      `DNSCAP_EXT_IS_RESPONDER` extension to know if an IP address is a
      "responder" or not, because when dnscap is instructed to collect ICMP
      with -I, it processes all ICMP packets, not just those limited to
      responders (or initiators).

    Until it can be confirmed that the threaded code works as well as the

    option to enable it during compilation.

    New extended option:
    - `-o pcap_buffer_size=<bytes>` can be used to increase the capture
      buffer within pcap-thread/libpcap, this can help mitigate dropped
      packets by the kernel during breaks (like when closing dump file).

    canceling and waiting on threads to join again. The handling of signals
    have been improved for threaded and non-threaded operations.

dnscap (1.2.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 1.2.0

    Update `pcap-thread` to v1.2.0 to get the new callback queue mode which
    puts that mode into using pthread conditions if all pcaps are offline and
    keeps us from losing packets.

    Use `pcap_thread_dropback()` callback to get the notification when a
    packet was dropped because the queue was full, indicating that we can't
    process all the packets.  Added this stats to the `-S` output as total
    and per interface as `ptdrop`.  Changed the output for each interface
    to not cut of information, for example interface name was cut to
    4 characters.

    Other changes:

    - Add extended options `-o <option>=<value>` because we are running out
      of short options.
    - Better handling of library checks and automake rules
    - New option `-F <format>` to specify the format of the output in `-w`
    - Add experimental CBOR output support
      - LDNS is used to parse the packets
      - Tinycbor is used to construct the CBOR output
      - DNS-in-JSON draft [1] for representing the objects
      - Check CBOR topic in README.md for more information
    - When only reading offline pcap files it will not attempt to drop
      privileges and add new option `-N` to explicitly not drop privileges.

  * Release 1.1.0

    The ownership of DNSCAP was transferred from ISC to DNS-OARC in
    the summer of 2016 and this is the first release since that.

    This project now uses Semantic Versioning and these are the changes
    since the `dnscap-20160205` release (which can also be found using
    the tag `v0.0.0-20160205`).

    Highlights:
    - Restructure repository and use autotools
    - Compiled and tested on Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, FreeBSD and OpenBSD
      using Jenkins and Travis-CI
    - Source code static analysis using Coverity Scan
    - Compatibility fixes for FreeBSD, OpenBSD and OS X
    - ABI change to `output()`, previous `isfrag` is now a `flags` that
      represents what the packet is through a bitmask
    - Use helper library `pcap-thread` when capturing to solve missing
      packets during very low traffic

    New command line options:
    - `-V`: Prints version and then exits
    - `-M`: Enable monitor mode on interfaces
    - `-D`: Enable immediate mode on interfaces
    - `-W`: Allow to specify a suffix for the pcap dump file
    - `-C`: Limit/rotate capture after a certain amount of bytes

    Special thanks to:
    - Duane Wessels
    - Paul Vixie
    - Klaus Darilion

    bc7eb22 Update license after ownership transfer from ISC to DNS-OARC,
            update contributors, add build badges and removed SuperFastHash
            since apparently it was not used.

    71c2d79 Fix #12: Sync man-page and help text
    33576ef Swap option C and D, C for this makes more sense. Also ensure
            that `capturedbytes` is zero on start.

            file, e. g.: '.pcap'
    097a3b4 Count every packet which is sent to output(), not only
            the normal ones.
    75e5968 Close PCAPs after dumper_close() to have statistics still
            available during dumper_close(). Otherwise we get a segfault
            on shutdown.

    7d6a7e4 Passing IPv6 fragment payloads may not currently be safe.
            Needs more work. For now pass pkt=NULL to be safe for plugins.
    ea8f9a4 Make the family of output() functions future proof with a flags
            bitmask. Rather than separate 'isfrag' and 'isdns' flags,
            they are now set as bitmasks in a single 'flags' value passed
            to output() f
    472a172 A change to the interface of the family of output() functions.

    864cbd7 Can you change #ifdef __APPLE__ to check for the
            arpa/nameser_compat.h header and include it if it exists?
    796e8ea plugin/rssm needs to include arpa/nameser_compat.h for OS X

    0061b57 Work around configure problem detecting libresolv on Mac OS X
            Without some #include files, the configure test won't find
            the symbol res_mkquery() in libresolv on OS X.  It is called
            res_9_mkquery()
    5309655 Mac OS X doesn't have setresuid() and setresgid().
            This patch adds configure checks for setreuid() and setregid()
            and will use those instead if the other versions are
            not available.
