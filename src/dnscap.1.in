.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a network capture utility designed specifically for DNS traffic.  It
normally produces binary data in
.Xr pcap 3
format, either on standard output or in successive dump files
(based on the
.Fl w
command line option).  This utility is similar to
.Xr tcpdump 1 ,
but has finer grained packet recognition tailored to DNS transactions and
protocol options.
.Nm
is expected to be used for gathering continuous research or audit traces.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width 10n
.It Fl ?
Prints some text to stdout describing the command line options, so that you
won't have to refer back to this man page as often.  Probably you will have
to say "-\\?" to get this option past your shell.
.It Fl V
Print version and exit.
.It Fl o
See EXTENDED OPTIONS.
.It Fl b
Run in background as daemon.
.It Fl N
Do not attempt to drop privileges, this is implicit if only reading
offline pcap files.
.It Fl p
Asks that the interface not be put into promiscuous mode.  Note that even
without this option, the interface could be in promiscuous mode for some other
reason.
.It Fl d
Tells a verbose story of options and patterns chosen, files opened, and so on.
(Multiple
.Fl d
options can be given to increase verbosity and frequency of trace messages.)
.It Fl 1
Flush the
.Xr pcap 3
packet dump after every packet.  Mostly this is useful when the
packet dump is standard output, and has been piped to
.Xr tcpdump 1 .
.It Fl g
Produce output on diagnostic output, showing the presentation form of DNS
messages which passed through all of the filters.  If
.Fl w
is also used, then every message will be dumped in both binary and
presentation form.
.It Fl 6
Suppress the use of packet filter patterns that are known (as of 2007) to
cause problems when processing IPv6 packets.  Recommended when IPv6 traffic is
expected to be present.
.It Fl f
Selects fragments (which could include unrelated flows since fragments do not
contain port numbers), and includes fragments in the binary output.  Necessary
if you intend to do IP Reassembly.  Note that all fragments will be collected,
not just those using the DNS port number, since fragments don't have port
numbers.  Beware this option if you also handle a lot of NFS traffic.
.It Fl T
Selects TCP packets.
SYN, FIN, and RST packets are collected if they pass the layer 2, port, and
host filters (although hosts need not be in the correct direction); they are
not tested against filter options that require a DNS header such as
.Fl m ,
.Fl s ,
and
.Fl e .
The first DNS header in the stream is captured if it passes all filter
options.
All subsequent non-empty packets in the stream, regardless of DNS message
boundaries, will be captured if and only if the first DNS header passed all
filter options.
TCP packets will usually not be printable with
.Fl g .
.It Fl I
Select ICMP and ICMPv6 packets.
.It Fl i Ar if
Select an interface to be monitored.  On BSD systems, the default is the first
interface that was configured at system boot time.  On Linux systems, the
default is to monitor all interfaces.  More than one interface may be selected
which will cause output to be interleaved from all selected interfaces.
.It Fl r Ar file
Select an offline
.Xr pcap 3
file produced by this utility or by
.Xr tcpdump 1
as the input packet source.  Can be given as "-" to indicate standard input.
.It Fl l Ar vlan
Captures only 802.1Q encapsulated packets, and selects specific vlans to be
monitored.  Can be specified more than once to select multiple vlans.
.Fl l Ar 4095
means "all vlans".
.It Fl L Ar vlan
Captures 802.1Q encapsulated packets matching the specified vlans AND
packets without VLAN tags. Can be specified more than one to select
multiple vlans.
.Fl L Ar 4095
means "all vlans".
.It Fl u Ar port
Capture only packets on this UDP port, and treat as DNS traffic.  The default
port is 53.  Note that there is no way to select multiple UDP ports, as would
be necessary to capture both DNS (port 53) and mDNS (port 5353) traffic.
.It Fl m Op qun
Capture only messages of designated types (query, update, and notify).
Default is query.
.It Fl e Op nytfsxir
Among responses, consider nonzero DNS TC or DNS RCODE to indicate an error,
and select only responses which do not have (n), or which have (y), these
conditions.  The default is to only select nonerrors among responses.  If
both nonerror and error responses are to be selected, specify both the
.Ar n
and
.Ar y
options here.
To be more specific, use one or more condition-specific options, as follows:
.sp
.Bl -tag -width indent -offset indent -compact
.It Va n
no error
.It Va y
some error
.It Va t
truncated response (TC bit)
.It Va f
format error (rcode 1)
.It Va s
server failure (rcode 2)
.It Va x
no such name (rcode 3)
.It Va i
not implemented (rcode 4)
.It Va r
refusal (rcode 5)
.El
.It Fl h Op ir
Hide initiator or responder of each captured transaction.  Hiding an initiator
means wiping out the address and port number.  Hiding a responder means to wipe
out the address only.  This wiping occurs on the copy of the packet sent to the
.Xr pcap 3
dump output, and both the IP and UDP checksums will be recomputed in that case.
.It Fl s Op ir
Select messages which are initiations and/or responses.  Default is both.
.It Fl a Ar host
Capture only transactions having these initiators.  Can be specified more than
once to select multiple initiators.  If a host name is used, then all of that
host's addresses whether IPv4 or IPv6 are added to the recognition pattern.
.It Fl z Ar host
Capture only transactions having these responders.  Can be specified more than
once to select multiple responders.  If a host name is used, then all of that
host's addresses whether IPv4 or IPv6 are added to the recognition pattern.
.It Fl A Ar host
Capture only transactions NOT having these initiators.
.It Fl Z Ar host
Capture only transactions NOT having these responders.
.It Fl Y Ar host
Drop responses having these responders.  Similar to
.Fl Z
in spirit.  However,
.Fl Y
applies only to responses and does not cause any additions to the BPF filter
string.
.It Fl w Ar base
Dump the captured packets to successive binary files in
.Xr pcap 3
format with DLT_RAW datalink type.
Each file will have a name like "%s.%u.%06u" where %s is
.Ar base ,
%u is the time in seconds, and %06u is the time in microseconds.  The argument
"-" may be given to send the binary output to standard output.  In that case,
the
.Fl c
and
.Fl t
options affect the total duration of the capture, and not merely the size and
time limits of each individual dump file.
.It Fl W Ar suffix
The provided suffix is added to the dump file name, e. g.: ".pcap"
.It Fl k Ar cmd
After each dump file specified by
.Fl w
is closed, this command will be executed in a nonblocking subprocess with the
file name as its one argument.  It's expected that this command will be a shell
script that submits the finished file to a batch processing analytics system.
Note that without
.Fl k ,
the program will exit at the first output closure due to
.Fl c
or
.Fl t .
.It Fl t Ar lim
By default,
.Nm
will close its packet dump file only when interrupted.  A time limit can be
specified with the
.Fl t
option.
When writing to a file, the packet dump file will be closed when time() %
.Ar lim
is zero and the first file will usually be shorter than
.Ar lim
seconds.
If the packet dump file is standard output, then after closing this
file,
.Nm
exits.  This option is inclusive with
.Fl c .
.It Fl c Ar lim
By default,
.Nm
will close its packet dump file only when interrupted.  A dump file size,
measured in packets, can be specified with the
.Fl c
option.  If the packet dump file is standard output, then after closing this
file,
.Nm
exits.  This option is inclusive with
.Fl t .
.It Fl C Ar lim
By default,
.Nm
will close its packet dump file only when interrupted.  A dump file size,
measured in bytes captured, can be specified with the
.Fl C
option.  If the packet dump file is standard output, then after closing this
file,
.Nm
exits.  This option is inclusive with
.Fl t .
.It Fl x Ar pat
If one or more
.Fl x
options are provided, then DNS messages will only be selected if the
printable representation of the QNAME or any RR matches at least one of the
provided
.Ar pat
patterns.  See
.Xr regex 3
and
.Xr re_format 7
for more information about extended regular expression syntax.
.It Fl X Ar pat
If one or more
.Fl X
options are provided, then DNS messages matching these patterns will not
be selected.  See the description of
.Fl x
above.
.Pp
NOTE: for reasons lost to the mists of time, it seems that
.Fl X
only takes effect when
.Fl x
is also used.  If you use
.Fl X
alone, you'll get no output.  Thus, you should at least use "-x ."
to initially match all queries and then exclude certain patterns with
.Fl X.
Users of the
.Fl X
option should be advised that this behavior could change in future versions.
.It Fl y
Enable Linux seccomp-bpf sandbox if available (compile option).
.It Fl S
Causes
.Nm
to print pcap_stats() counters on stderr when
.Fl t
,
.Fl c
or
.Fl C
limits are reached.
.It Fl B Ar datetime
When using
.Fl w ,
the
.Fl B
option tells
.Nm
to start collecting at a specific time.
.Ar datetime
should be specified as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.  The program will
.Xr sleep 3
until the start time, and then begin capturing packets.
.It Fl E Ar datetime
When using
.Fl w
and
.Fl t ,
the
.Fl E
option tells
.Nm
to stop collecting at a specific time.
.Ar datetime
should be specified as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.  The program will exit
when it sees a packet with timestamp greater than
.Ar datetime .
.It Fl M
Enable monitor mode on interfaces.
.It Fl D
Enable immediate mode on interfaces.
.It Fl U Ar str
Append "and
.Ar str
" to the pcap filter.
.It Fl P Ar plugin.so ...
Load and use the specified plugin. Any options given after this are
sent to the plugin.
.El
.Pp
If started with no options,
.Nm
will exit with a complaint that without either the
.Fl w
or
.Fl g
options, it's pointless to run the program at all.  In its simplest form,
the output can be piped to
.Xr tcpdump 1
as in:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dnscap -w - | tcpdump -r -
.Ed
.Pp
You can safely add the
.Fl d
option since the output resulting from
.Fl d
goes to diagnostic output rather than standard output.  And since everybody
who's anybody always uses the
.Fl n
option to
.Xr tcpdump 1 ,
the minimum useful incantation is probably:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dnscap -w - | tcpdump -r - -n
.Ed
.Pp
The more interesting use for
.Nm
is long term or continuous data collection.  Assuming a shell script called
.Ar dnscap-upload
whose function is to transfer a
.Xr pcap 3 -
format file to an analytics system and then remove the local copy of it, then
a name server operating system startup could invoke
.Nm
for continuous DNS auditing using a command like:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dnscap -m qun -h i -r f.root-servers.net \\
       -b /var/local/dnscaps/f-root -t 1800 \\
       -k /usr/local/sbin/dnscap-upload
.Ed
.Pp
A bizarre but actual example which combines almost all features of
.Nm
is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dnscap -d -w - -1 -i em0 -l 0 -x ^7 | \\
       dnscap -d -r - -X spamhaus -g -l 0
.Ed
.Pp
Here, we're looking for all messages having a QNAME or RR beginning with the
decimal digit "7", but we don't want to see anything containing "spamhaus".
The interface is tagged, and since only one interface is selected, the output
stream from the first
.Nm
will also be tagged, thus we need
.Fl l Ar 0
on both
.Nm
commands.
.Sh EXTENDED OPTIONS
The following extended options exists and some of them might also exist
as a short option.
.Bl -tag -width 10n

Number of bytes of memory to use for each DNS packet.
.It cds_max_rlabels=<num>
Number of labels to keep in the reverse label index.
.It cds_min_rlabel_size=<num>
The minimum size of a label to be able to use the reverse label index.
.It cds_use_rdata_index=yes
Use the resource data index, default no.
.It cds_rdata_index_min_size=<num>
The minimum size of the data to be able to use the resource data index.
.It cds_use_rdata_rindex=yes
Use the resource data reverse index, default no.
.It cds_rdata_rindex_size=<num>
Number of resource data to keep in the resource data reverse index.
.It cds_rdata_rindex_min_size=<num>
The minimum size of the data to be able to use the resource data reverse index.
.It dump_format=<format>

.It user=<user>
Specify the user to drop privileges to (default nobody).
.It group=<group>
Specify the group to drop privileges to (default nobody).
.It pcap_buffer_size=<num>
Set the
.Xr pcap 3pcap
buffer size to use when capturing packets, can be used too not miss packets
during processing.
.El
.Sh OUTPUT FORMATS
The following output format are supported:
.Bl -tag -width 10n
.It cbor
Uses tinycbor library to write CBOR objects that are based on DNS-in-JSON
draft by Paul Hoffman.
.It cds
CBOR DNS Stream format.
.It pcap
This uses the pcap library to output the captured DNS packets.
.El
.Sh "COMPATIBILITY NOTES"
If
.Nm dnscap
produces no output, it's probably due to some kind of bug in your kernel's
.Xr bpf 4
module or in your
.Xr pcap 3
library.  You may need the
.Fl 6
or
.Fl l Ar 0
options.  To diagnose your way out of "no output" hell, use the
.Fl d
and
.Fl g
options to find out what BPF program is being internally generated, and
then cut/paste this BPF program onto a
.Xr tcpdump 1
command line to see if it likewise produces no output.

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
was written by Paul Vixie (ISC) with help from Duane Wessels,
Kevin Brintnall, and others too numerous to mention.

Ought to handle fragmented UDP.
.Pp
Ought to be re-implented as a
.Xr ncap
client.
.Pp
Too many design botches within
.Xr bpf 4
and
.Xr pcap 3
are made visible to the user of this utility.
.Pp
.Fl X
doesn't necessarily work without an "enclosing"
.Fl x
option.
