dnscap is a network capture utility designed specifically for DNS
traffic. It produces binary data in pcap(3) format. This utility
is similar to tcpdump(1), but has a number of features tailored
to DNS transactions and protocol options.

%changelog
* Wed Mar 29 2017 Jerry Lundström <lundstrom.jerry@gmail.com> 1.4.1-1
- Release 1.4.1
  * Fixed an issue that when compiled with libpcap that had a specific
    feature enabled it would result in a runtime error which could not be
    worked around.
  * Also fixed various compatibility issues and updated dependency
    documentation for CentOS.
  * Commits:
    785d4c4 Fix compiler warnings
    2d4df8d Fix #65: Update pcap-thread to v2.1.2
    26d3fbc Fix #64: Add missing dependency
    55e6741 Update pcap-thread to v2.1.1, fix issue with libpcap timestamp
            type
    c6fdb7a Fix typo and remove unused variables
* Mon Feb 27 2017 Jerry Lundström <lundstrom.jerry@gmail.com> 1.4.0-1
- Release 1.4.0
  * Until it can be confirmed that the threaded code works as well as the
    non-threaded code it has been made optional and requires a configuration
    option to enable it during compilation.
  * New extended option:
    - `-o pcap_buffer_size=<bytes>` can be used to increase the capture
      buffer within pcap-thread/libpcap, this can help mitigate dropped
      packets by the kernel during breaks (like when closing dump file).
  * Commits:
    1c6fbb2 Update copyright year
    63ef665 Suppress OpenBSD warnings about symbols

- Release 1.3.0
  * Rare lockup has been fixed that could happen if a signal was received
    in the wrong thread at the wrong time due to `pcap_thread_stop()`
    canceling and waiting on threads to join again. The handling of signals
    have been improved for threaded and non-threaded operations.
  * New features:
    - Experimental CBOR DNS Stream format output, see `CBOR_DNS_STREAM.md`
    - Extended options to specify user and group to use when dropping
      privileges, see EXTENDED OPTIONS in man-page
