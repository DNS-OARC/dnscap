%description
dnscap is a network capture utility designed specifically for DNS
traffic. It produces binary data in pcap(3) format. This utility
is similar to tcpdump(1), but has a number of features tailored
to DNS transactions and protocol options.

* Fri Feb 12 2021 Jerry Lundström <lundstrom.jerry@gmail.com> 2.0.0-1
- Release 2.0.0
  * This major release contains three backward incompatible changes, two
    new command line options and a completely restructured man-page(!),
    please read the change notes carefully before upgrading!
  * The first backward incompatible change has to do with the removal of
    libbind dependency. This library was causing segfaults on OpenBSD due to
    shared (and overwritten) symbols with OpenBSD's libc.
    It was replaced with LDNS and LDNS renders domain names as Fully
    Qualified Domain Names (FQDN, the trailing dot!) so every output of a
    domain name has been changed to a FQDN.
    This also changes `-X`/`-x`, which will now match against FQDNs.
  * The second backward incompatible change is that `-6` has been removed.
    This was used to alter the BPF in order to "fix" it, dnscap adds
    specific filters to IP and UDP headers which does not work for IPv6
    traffic.
    The generated BPF has been changed to allow IPv6 to always pass, making
    the option obsolete. IPv6 filtering is then done in dnscap.
  * The last backward incompatible change has to do with the output format
    of `-g` related to EDNS0 and is now more consistent with the rest of
    the parsable output:
    - No more spaces in the output
    - Fix incorrect `\` and extra empty new-line
    - All EDNS0 options are added after `edns0[...]` using comma separation, example: `edns0[],edns0opt[],...`
    - Client Subnet format: `edns0opt[ECS,family=nn,source=nn,scope=nn,addr=...]`
    - Unknown/unsupported code: `edns0opt[code=nn,codelen=nn]`
    - Parsing error messages have changed, they came from libbind, now comes from LDNS
  * New options:
    - Add `-q` and `-Q` to filter on matched/not matched QTYPE
  * Bugfixes:
    - Fix memory leak in EDNS0 ECS address parsing
    - `network`: Fix sonarcloud issues, potential `memcpy()` of null pointer
  * Other changes:
    - Fix CBOR output inclusion, LDNS is always available now
    - Add macros for Apple and Windows endian functions
    - Restructure and correct the man-page

* Thu Oct 22 2020 Jerry Lundström <lundstrom.jerry@gmail.com> 1.12.0-1
- Release 1.12.0
  * This release fixes the handling of `-?` option for dnscap and all plugins,
    previously the handling varied between places and depending on `getopt()`
    implementation an invalid option could return the wrong exit code.
  * Other changes:
    - Fix typo in configure help text
    - `plugins/anonmask`: Fix typo in help text
    - `plugins/rzkeychange`:
      - Add `-D`, dry run mode, for testing
      - Fix handling of `-a` and error on too many
  * KNOWN ISSUES:
    On OpenBSD the system library libc exports the same symbols as libbind
    does and this causes runtime warnings. Until now this has not caused any
    known problems but is now also causing segfaults if the packet filter used
    (BPF) includes IPv6 addresses.
    On all other platforms OARC supports, these symbols are macros and in so
    should not cause any problem.

* Thu Aug 20 2020 Jerry Lundström <lundstrom.jerry@gmail.com> 1.11.1-1
- Release 1.11.1
  * This release fixes a lot of issues found by code analysis, adds a
    explicit memory zeroing function to remove account information (read
    when dropping privileges) and adds code coverage reporting.
  * The `dnscap_memzero()` will use `explicit_bzero()` on FreeBSD and
    OpenBSD, or `memset_s()` (if supported), otherwise it will manually
    set the memory to zero. This will hopefully ensure that the memory
    is zeroed as compilers can optimize out `memset()`'s that is just
    before `free()`.
  * The plugins exit code for the help option `-?` has been changed to 0
    to have the same as `dnscap -?`.

* Mon Dec 03 2018 Jerry Lundström <lundstrom.jerry@gmail.com> 1.10.0-1
- Release 1.10.0
  * This release adds a new plugin type "filter" and 5 new plugins that can
    do anonymization, deanonymization and masking of the IP addresses.
  * New features:
    - Check plugins for `pluginname_type()` which returns `enum plugin_type`,
      if missing the plugin is counted as an "output" plugin
    - New plugin type "filter" which calls `pluginname_filter()` prior of
      outputting any data or calling of "output" plugins, if the new function
      returns non-zero then the packet is filtered out (dropped)
    - New extension `DNSCAP_EXT_SET_IADDR` that gives access to a function
      for setting the from and to IP addresses both in the extracted data
      and the wire
  * New plugins:
    - `anonaes128`: Anonymize IP addresses using AES128
    - `anonmask`: Pseudo-anonymize IP addresses by masking them
    - `cryptopan`: Anonymize IP addresses using an extension to Crypto-PAn
      (College of Computing, Georgia Tech) made by David Stott (Lucent)
    - `cryptopant`: Anonymize IP addresses using cryptopANT, a different
      implementation of Crypto-PAn made by the ANT project at USC/ISI
    - `ipcrypt`: Anonymize IP addresses using ipcrypt create by
      Jean-Philippe Aumasson
  * Bugfixes:
    - Fix changing `royparse` and `txtout` with other plugins (thanks to
      Duane Wessels and Paul Hoffman)
    - Free pointers to allocated strings in `text_free()` (thanks to Michał
      Kępień)
    - Fix IP checksum calculation
  * Other changes:
    - `-B` and `-E` can be used without `-w` (thanks to Duane Wessels)
    - Use `pcap_findalldevs()` instead of `pcap_lookupdev()` (thanks to
      Michał Kępień)
    - Document and add `-?` option to all plugins
    - Fix clang `scan-build` bugs and LGTM alerts
    - Use `gmtime_r()` instead of `gmtime()`
    - Update `pcap-thread` to v4.0.0

* Wed Feb 28 2018 Jerry Lundström <lundstrom.jerry@gmail.com> 1.9.0-1
- Release 1.9.0
  * This release adds a new option to change how the Berkeley Packet Filter
    is generated to include the host restrictions for all selections,
    previously this restriction would only apply to specific parts.
  * Additional tweaks to the RSSM plugin has been made to conform to the
    RSSAC002v3 specification. One noticeable change is that the plugin now
    requires the DNS to be parsed before counted, any error in the parsing
    will result in the message being left out of the statistics.
  * Changes:
    - Fix spacing in BPF filter to look better
    - Fix #146: Add `bpf_hosts_apply_all`, apply any host restriction to all
    - `plugin/rssm`:
      - Remove quoting of `start-period` and correctly handle empty hashes
      - Issue #152, Issue #91: Parse DNS before processing RSSM counters
    - `plugin/rssm/dnscap-rssm-rssac002`: Use `YAML::Dump()` for output
  * Commits:

* Wed Feb 07 2018 Jerry Lundström <lundstrom.jerry@gmail.com> 1.8.0-1
- Release 1.8.0
  * This release updates the TCP stream code in order to be able to look
    at more then just the first query, for handling already ongoing TCP
    connections without having seen SYN/ACK and for reassembly of the TCP
    stream prior of parsing it for DNS with an additional layer of parsing
    (see `reassemble_tcp_bfbparsedns`).
  * Updates to the Root Server Scaling Measurement (RSSM) plugin have also
    been made to bring it up to date with RSSAC002v3 specification, be
    able to output the YAML format described and an additional script to
    merge YAML files if the interval is less then the RSSAC002v3 24 hour
    period. See "Updates to the RSSM plugin" below and
    `plugins/rssm/README.md`.
  * New extended options:
    - `parse_ongoing_tcp`: Start tracking TCP connections even if SYN/ACK
      has not been seen
    - `allow_reset_tcpstate`: Allow external reset of TCP state
    - `reassemble_tcp`: Use to enable TCP stream reassembly
    - `reassemble_tcp_faultreset`: Number of faults before reseting TCP
      state when reassembly is enabled
    - `reassemble_tcp_bfbparsedns`: Enable an experimental additional layer
      of reassemble that uses `libbind` to parse the payload before accepting
      it. If the DNS is invalid it will move 2 bytes within the payload and
      treat it as a new payload, taking the DNS length again and restart
      the process. Requires `libbind` and `reassemble_tcp`.
  * New extension functions for plugins:
    - `DNSCAP_EXT_TCPSTATE_GETCURR`: Function to get a pointer for the
      current TCP state
    - `DNSCAP_EXT_TCPSTATE_RESET`: Function to reset a TCP state
  * New features:
    - Parse additional DNS queries in TCP connections
    - `-g` and the `txtout` plugin will reset TCP state (if allowed) on
      failure to parse DNS
  * Bugfixes:
    - Fix `-g` output, separate error message with a space
    - Fix TCP packets wrongfully flagged as DNS when using layers.
    - Fix TCP debug output when using layers, `ia_str()` is not safe to call
      twice in the same `printf` because of local buffer.
    - Fix exported extension functions, need to be file local
  * New tests for:
    - Multiple DNS queries in one TCP connection
    - Query over TCP without SYN
    - Queries over TCP with first query missing length
    - Queries over TCP with middle payloads missing
    - Add test with TCP stream that missing multiple packets in the middle
  * Updates to the RSSM plugin (`plugins/rssm`):
    - Add info about saving counts and sources
    - Fix memory leak on `fopen()` errors
    - Update to RSSAC002v3 specification
    - New options:
      - `-D` to disable forking on close
      - `-Y`: Use RSSAC002v3 YAML format when writing counters, the file
        will contain multiple YAML documents, one for each RSSAC002v3 metric
        Used with; -S adds custom metric `dnscap-rssm-sources` and -A adds
        `dnscap-rssm-aggregated-sources`
      - `-n`: Set the service name to use in RSSAC002v3 YAML
      - `-S`: Write source IPs into counters file with the prefix `source`
      - `-A`: Write aggregated IPv6(/64) sources into counters file with
        the prefix `aggregated-source`
      - `-a`: Write aggregated IPv6(/64) sources to
        `<name>.<timesec>.<timeusec>`
    - Add `dnscap-rssm-rssac002` Perl script for merging RSSAC002v3 YAML files
    - Add README.md for the plugin man-page for `dnscap-rssm-rssac002`
    - Add test for YAML output and merging of YAML files

* Wed Dec 27 2017 Jerry Lundström <lundstrom.jerry@gmail.com> 1.7.1-1
- Release 1.7.1
  * The library used for parsing DNS (libbind) is unable to parse DNS
    messages when there is padding at the end (the UDP/TCP payload is larger
    then the DNS message). This has been fixed by trying to find the actual
    DNS message size, walking all labels and RR data, and then retry parsing.
  * Other changes and bug-fixes:
    - Fix size when there is a VLAN to match output of `use_layers` yes/no
    - Add test of VLAN matching
    - Fix `hashtbl.c` building in `rssm`
    - Add test with padded DNS message

            actual size and reparse
    99bda0b Fix #98: VLAN
* Tue Dec 19 2017 Jerry Lundström <lundstrom.jerry@gmail.com> 1.7.0-1
- Release 1.7.0
  * This release adds IP fragmentation handling by using layers in pcap-thread
    which also adds a new flag to output and modules. `DNSCAP_OUTPUT_ISLAYER`
    indicates that `pkt_copy` is equal to `payload` since the layers of the
    traffic have already been parsed. IP fragments are reassembled with the
    `pcap_thread_ext_frag` extension that is included in pcap-thread.
  * New extended (`-o`) options:
    - `use_layers`: Use pcap-thread layers to handle the traffic
    - `defrag_ipv4`: Enabled IPv4 de-fragmentation
    - `defrag_ipv6`: Enabled IPv6 de-fragmentation
    - `max_ipv4_fragments`: Set maximum fragmented IPv4 packets to track
    - `max_ipv4_fragments_per_packet`: Set the maximum IPv4 fragments per
      tracked packet
    - `max_ipv6_fragments`: Set maximum fragmented IPv6 packets to track
    - `max_ipv6_fragments_per_packet`: Set the maximum IPv6 fragments per
      tracked packet
  * Currently `-w` does not work with `use_layers` and the plugins `pcapdump`
    and `royparse` will discard output with the flag `DNSCAP_OUTPUT_ISLAYER`
    because they need access to the original packet.
  * The `rzkeychange` plugin now encodes certain flag bits in the data that
    it reports for RFC8145 key tag signaling. The flags of interest are:
    `DO`, `CD`, and `RD`. These are encoded in an bit-mask as a hexadecimal
    value before the `_ta` component of the query name.
  * Other changes and bug-fixes:
    - Fix #115: document `-g` output, see `OUTPUT FORMATS` `diagnostic` in
      `dnscap(1)` man-page
    - Add test to match output from non-layers runs with those using layers
    - Add test with fragmented DNS queries
    - Fix #120: CBOR/CDS compiles again, update tinycbor to v0.4.2
    - Fix `ip->ip_len` byte order
    - Fix parsing of IP packets with padding or missing parts of payload

* Fri Dec 01 2017 Jerry Lundström <lundstrom.jerry@gmail.com> 1.6.0-1
- Release 1.6.0
  * New additions to the plugins:
    - `rzkeychange` can now collect RFC8145 key tag signaling. Signals are
      saved during the collection interval, and then sent to the specified
      `-k <zone>`, one at a time, at the end of the interval. Only root zone
      signals are collected. Added by Duane Wessels (@wessels).
    - `royparse` is a new plugin to splits a PCAP into two streams, queries
      in PCAP format and responses in ASCII format. Created by Roy Arends
      (@RoyArends).
    - `txtout` new option `-s` for short output, only print QTYPE and QNAME
      for IN records. Added by Paul Hoffman (@paulehoffman)
    - The extension interface has been extended with `DNSCAP_EXT_IA_STR` to
      export the `ia_str()` function.
  * Bugfixes and other changes:
    - Remove duplicated hashtbl code
    - `rssm`: fix bug where count in table was taken out as `uint16_t` but
      was a `uint64_t`
    - Handle return values from hashtbl functions
    - `txtout`: removed unused `-f` options
    - Change `ia_str()` to use buffers with correct sizes, thanks to
      @RoyArends for spotting this!

* Tue Jun 06 2017 Jerry Lundström <lundstrom.jerry@gmail.com> 1.5.0-1
- Release 1.5.0
  * Added support for writing gzipped PCAP if the `-W` suffix ends with
    `.gz` and made `-X` work without `-x`. New inteface for plugins to
    tell them what extensions are available and a new plugin `rzkeychange`.
  * Plugin extensions:
    - Call `plugin_extension(ext, arg)` to tell plugin what extensions exists
    - Add extension for checking responder (`is_responder()`)
  * The rzkeychange plugin was developed by Duane Wessels 2016 in support
    of the root zone ZSK size increase. It is also being used in support of
    the 2017 root KSK rollover and collects the following measurements:
    - total number of responses sent
    - number of responses with TC bit set
    - number of responses over TCP
    - number of DNSKEY responses
    - number of ICMP_UNREACH_NEEDFRAG messages received
    - number of ICMP_TIMXCEED_INTRANS messages received
    - number of ICMP_TIMXCEED_REASS messages received
  * Other fixes (author Duane Wessels):
    - 232cbd0: Correct comment description for meaning of IPPROTO_AH
    - 181eaa4: Add #include <sys/time.h> for struct timeval on NetBSD
  * Commits:

  * Commits during development of rzkeychange (author Duane Wessels):
    - 620828d: Add rzkeychange -z option to specify resolver IP addresses
    - 1f77987: Add -p and -t options to rzkeychange plugin to configure an
      alternate port and TCP. Useful for ssh tunnels.
    - 2a571f1: Split ICMP time exceeded counter into two counters for time
      exceeded due to TTL and another due to fragmentation
    - e4ee2d3: The rzkeychange data collection plugin uses
      `DNSCAP_EXT_IS_RESPONDER` extension to know if an IP address is a
      "responder" or not, because when dnscap is instructed to collect ICMP
      with -I, it processes all ICMP packets, not just those limited to
      responders (or initiators).
    - cee16b8: Add ICMP Time Exceeded to counters
    - ad8a227: Counting source IPs has performance impacts. #ifdef'd out for
      now add ICMP "frag needed" counts
    - c25e72b: Implemented DNS queries with ldns. First there will be some
      test queries to ensure the zone is reachable and configured to receive
      data. Then a query naming the fields, followed by the periodic queries
      delivering counts.
    - fd23be7: Make report zone, server, node command line argumements mandatory
    - 137789b: Adding rzkeychange plugin files
* Wed Mar 29 2017 Jerry Lundström <lundstrom.jerry@gmail.com> 1.4.1-1
- Release 1.4.1
  * Fixed an issue that when compiled with libpcap that had a specific
    feature enabled it would result in a runtime error which could not be
    worked around.
  * Also fixed various compatibility issues and updated dependency
    documentation for CentOS.

* Mon Feb 27 2017 Jerry Lundström <lundstrom.jerry@gmail.com> 1.4.0-1
- Release 1.4.0
  * Until it can be confirmed that the threaded code works as well as the
    non-threaded code it has been made optional and requires a configuration
    option to enable it during compilation.
  * New extended option:
    - `-o pcap_buffer_size=<bytes>` can be used to increase the capture
      buffer within pcap-thread/libpcap, this can help mitigate dropped
      packets by the kernel during breaks (like when closing dump file).
  * Commits:
    1c6fbb2 Update copyright year
    63ef665 Suppress OpenBSD warnings about symbols
    2c99946 pcap-thread v2.0.0, disable threads, errors handling

* Fri Dec 23 2016 Jerry Lundström <lundstrom.jerry@gmail.com> 1.3.0-1
- Release 1.3.0
  * Rare lockup has been fixed that could happen if a signal was received
    in the wrong thread at the wrong time due to `pcap_thread_stop()`
    canceling and waiting on threads to join again. The handling of signals
    have been improved for threaded and non-threaded operations.
  * New features:
    - Experimental CBOR DNS Stream format output, see `CBOR_DNS_STREAM.md`
    - Extended options to specify user and group to use when dropping
      privileges, see EXTENDED OPTIONS in man-page
