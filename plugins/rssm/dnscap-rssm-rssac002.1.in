This Perl script will merge and remove metric specific to this plugin and
replace others to fill in correct values for the new time period.
The earliest
.I start-period
found will be used for all metrics.

is performed, it is up to the operator to only give input files related
to the same 24 hour period.

.B \--no-recompile
Disabled the combining of metrics and the removal of metrics specific to
this plugin.
.TP
.B \--keep-dnscap-rssm
Do the combining but keep the metrics specific to this plugin.
.TP
.B \--sort
Output will always start with
.IR version: ,
.IR service: ,
.I start-period:
and

rest of the values are not ordered by label.
This option enabled sorting of them, which is not required by the
specification but may help in debugging and testing cases.
