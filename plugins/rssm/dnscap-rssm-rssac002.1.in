This Perl script will merge and remove metric specific to this plugin and
replace others to fill in correct values for the new time period.
The earliest
.I start-period
found will be used for all metrics.

is performed, it is up to the operator to only give input files related
to the same 24 hour period.

.TP
.B \--no-recompile
Disabled the combining of metrics and the removal of metrics specific to
this plugin.
.TP
.B \--keep-dnscap-rssm
Do the combining but keep the metrics specific to this plugin.
.TP
.B \--sort
Output will always start with
.IR version: ,
.IR service: ,
.I start-period:
and
.IR metric: ,
rest of the values are not ordered by label.
This option enabled sorting of them, which is not required by the
specification but may help in debugging and testing cases.
